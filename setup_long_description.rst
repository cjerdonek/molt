`Molt <http://cjerdonek.github.com/molt/>`_ is a script to stub out
projects in any language instantly using
`Mustache <http://mustache.github.com/>`_-based project templates.

You can use Molt to decrease the amount of boilerplate code you need to
write when starting any new project: the README, copyright notices,
license info, logging configuration, option parsing, test harness,
packaging information, ``.gitignore``, directory hierarchy, etc.

A minimal sample usage looks like--

::

    $ molt -c path_to_config.json path_to_template_dir/

Molt follows the `Groome <http://cjerdonek.github.com/groome/>`_ rules
for Mustache-based project templates. See the
`Groome <http://cjerdonek.github.com/groome/>`_ page for project
template syntax. This version of Molt follows `version
0.1.0 <https://github.com/cjerdonek/groome/tree/v0.1.0>`_ of Groome.

Molt is written in `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ and can be found
on `GitHub <https://github.com/cjerdonek/molt>`_ and on
`PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/molt>`_ (the Python Package Index).

Requirements
------------

Molt supports the following Python versions:

-  Python 2.7
-  `PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`_

Python 3.x support is coming soon. Since Molt is a development tool,
there are no plans to support Python 2.6 or earlier.

Molt's dependencies are--

-  `Pystache <https://github.com/defunkt/pystache>`_ version
   `0.5.2 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pystache>`_ or above
-  `PyYAML <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML>`_ (optional, to support
   YAML format for configuration files)

The installation process below installs these dependencies
automatically.

Both `setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_ and
`Distribute <http://packages.python.org/distribute/>`_ (preferred) are
supported for installing.

Install It
----------

::

    $ pip install molt

Test it
-------

::

    $ molt --run-tests

Try it
------

Start with the
`demo <https://github.com/cjerdonek/molt/tree/master/molt/demo>`_ Groome
template to play with:

::

    $ molt --create-demo --output demo
    $ ls -p demo
    expected/   lambdas/    partials/   sample.json structure/

Render the template with the sample context provided:

::

    $ molt --output output --config demo/sample.json demo

Run the newly-created project (which can also be seen
`here <https://github.com/cjerdonek/molt/tree/master/molt/demo/expected>`_)):

::

    $ python output/hello.py world
    Hello, world!

For help documentation and available options--

::

    $ molt -h

Note the ``--visualize`` and ``--with-visualize`` options that let you
quickly visualize entire directory contents.

::

    $ molt --visualize output

If using Python, you can also use Molt as a library (though the API is
not yet stable). See the ``Molter`` class in the
```molt.molter`` <https://github.com/cjerdonek/molt/blob/master/molt/molter.py>`_
module.

Contribute
----------

If using `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_, after forking--

::

    $ git clone git@github.com:yourusername/molt.git
    $ cd molt
    $ git remote add upstream git://github.com/cjerdonek/molt.git
    $ git fetch upstream

To run unit tests--

::

    $ python test_molt.py

This is equivalent to--

::

    $ python -m molt.commands.molt --run-tests [plus more options]

In particular, to test from source any molt command of the form--

::

    $ molt [options] [DIRECTORY]

simply type--

::

    $ python -m molt.commands.molt [options] [DIRECTORY]

To include the Groome
`tests <https://github.com/cjerdonek/groome/tree/master/tests>`_ in your
test runs, initialize and update the Groome project submodule--

::

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

To run a subset of the tests, you can filter your test runs using one or
more prefixes. For example--

::

    $ python test_molt.py molt.test.common molt.test.dir
